# admin-dashboard

A front-end layout containing project cards, announcements, and a list of trending users. This project was created to practice CSS grid as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard). 

## Outstanding Issues
- Background does not fill the screen when the user changes the window size
